This project was created on a lovely February afternoon as a review activity for the web development class I was teaching. It presents a basic Jeopardy game, with questions hardcoded in `App.js`. The game allows displaying a question, clicking to display the answer, and then marking that question as answered and displaying it on the main screen.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
